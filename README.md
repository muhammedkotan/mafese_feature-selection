# mafese_feature-selection
Feature selection web app using mafese

This page was developed for quick testing of metaheuristic optimization techniques in feature selection studies. The application interface is developed with gradio. https://gradio.app/

The Mafese and Mealpy libraries are used for the methods here.* Please refer to the original pages for details:*
